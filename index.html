          Poverty means not having enough money for basic needs such as food,
          drinking water, shelter, or toiletries. Many people in different
          countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of West and
          Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and some parts of
          Asia.Poverty is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress.

          Established in 1999, the mission of HELP International is to fight
          poverty and empower people. HELP does this by connecting individual
          donors and companies to the most urgent issues facing global
          communities today and by creating sustainable, life-changing
          development programs for you to go to the field and work with us
          directly. Our unique model allows you to contribute directly to the
          most urgent global needs by either 1) donating directly to our
          carefully evaluated projects and programs, catalyzing the efforts of
          our local partners on the ground as we work together to co-create
          change or 2) by choosing to participate yourself and volunteer
          in-country with us, creating and over-seeing projects with a team to
          alleviate poverty.

        <p class="">
          Service is at the heart of everything we do. From America’s
          underserved urban neighborhoods to the world’s economically poorest
          rural villages, we empower people to take on the most pressing issues
          in their communities through direct action. It’s not about what we do
          for the students and families we serve with, but what they do for
          their communities, our world, and themselves.We believe that the
          people closest to challenges of poverty and illiteracy are best
          positioned to address these issues. In the U.S., this means empowering
          youth to investigate the biggest concerns facing their communities and
          providing opportunities for them to take action. Globally, we don’t
          build schools for communities, we build schools with communities,
          putting local residents in leadership roles and employing a
          construction model that centers on collaborative service.
