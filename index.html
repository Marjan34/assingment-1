          is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress. One way of helping
          lower <span class="red"> <b>poverty</b></span> is by educating poor
          people so that they can start contributing to a nation's economic
          development. Education teaches the poor about their rights and may
          show them the path to become an important part of the growth and
          expansion of the country. Vienna Declaration also tells this fact.

          Established in <span class="red"><b>1999</b></span
          >, the mission of HELP International is to fight poverty and empower
          people. HELP does this by connecting individual donors and companies
          to the most urgent issues facing global communities today and by
          creating sustainable, life-changing development programs for you to go
          to the field and work with us directly. Our unique model allows you to
          contribute directly to the most urgent global needs by either 1)
          donating directly to our carefully evaluated projects and programs,
          catalyzing the efforts of our local partners on the ground as we work
          together to co-create change or 2) by choosing to participate yourself
          and volunteer in-country with us, creating and over-seeing projects
          with a team to alleviate poverty.

        <p class="">
          <span class="red"><b> Service</b></span> is at the heart of everything
          we do. From America’s underserved urban neighborhoods to the world’s
          economically poorest rural villages, we empower people to take on the
          most pressing issues in their communities through direct action. It’s
          not about what we do for the students and families we serve with, but
          what they do for their communities, our world, and themselves.We
          believe that the people closest to challenges of poverty and
          illiteracy are best positioned to address these issues. In the U.S.,
          this means empowering youth to investigate the biggest concerns facing
          their communities and providing opportunities for them to take action.
          Globally, we don’t build schools for communities, we build schools
          with communities, putting local residents in leadership roles and
          employing a construction model that centers on collaborative service.

            Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance
            on vaccination. Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from
            others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close
            contact. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not
            possible and in poorly ventilated settings. Clean your hands
            frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Cover your
            mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
            Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. If
