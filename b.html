          Poverty means not having enough money for basic needs such as food,
          drinking water, shelter, or toiletries. Many people in different
          countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of West and
          Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and some parts of
          Asia.Poverty is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress. One way
          of helping lower poverty is by educating poor people so that they can
          start contributing to a nation's economic development. Education
          teaches the poor about their rights and may show them the path to
          become an important part of the growth and expansion of the country.
          Vienna Declaration also tells this fact.

          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p class="p2">
            Our mission is to link the church of the First World with the church
            of the Third World in a manner that helps both the materially poor
            and the poor in spirit.

          <h3>Vission</h3>
          <p class="p2">
            Food For The Poor is God’s instrument to help the materially poor
            and to renew the poor in spirit. Our ministry is a reflection of our
            Lord’s unconditional love – a love that surrenders all, that
            inspires trust and faith, and that embraces all people, regardless
            of race, status or creed. It is also shaped by our belief that
            Christ is alive and can be served directly by serving those in
            greatest need.

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p class="p2">
            Caring for the poor and needy people and helping them is a noble
            endeavor. The more you give to poor and needy people, the more you
            strengthen their dependency. If you give them the chance or
            opportunity, you'll see an effective and long-lasting improvement in
            their lives.

            Established in 1999, the mission of HELP International is to fight
            poverty and empower people. HELP does this by connecting individual
            donors and companies to the most urgent issues facing global
            communities today and by creating sustainable, life-changing
            development programs for you to go to the field and work with us
            directly. Our unique model allows you to contribute directly to the
            most urgent global needs by either 1) donating directly to our
            carefully evaluated projects and programs, catalyzing the efforts of
            our local partners on the ground as we work together to co-create
            change or 2) by choosing to participate yourself and volunteer
            in-country with us, creating and over-seeing projects with a team to
            alleviate poverty.

        <p class="">
          Service is at the heart of everything we do. From America’s
          underserved urban neighborhoods to the world’s economically poorest
          rural villages, we empower people to take on the most pressing issues
          in their communities through direct action. It’s not about what we do
          for the students and families we serve with, but what they do for
          their communities, our world, and themselves.We believe that the
          people closest to challenges of poverty and illiteracy are best
          positioned to address these issues. In the U.S., this means empowering
          youth to investigate the biggest concerns facing their communities and
          providing opportunities for them to take action. Globally, we don’t
          build schools for communities, we build schools with communities,
          putting local residents in leadership roles and employing a
          construction model that centers on collaborative service.

            Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance
            on vaccination. Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from
            others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close
            contact. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not
            possible and in poorly ventilated settings. Clean your hands
            frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Cover your
            mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
            Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. If
            you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate
            until you recover.
