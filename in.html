          Poverty means not having enough money for basic needs such as food,
          drinking water, shelter, or toiletries. Many people in different
          countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of West and
          Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and some parts of
          Asia.Poverty is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress. One way
          of helping lower poverty is by educating poor people so that they can
          start contributing to a nation's economic development. Education
          teaches the poor about their rights and may show them the path to
          become an important part of the growth and expansion of the country.
          Vienna Declaration also tells this fact.

          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p class="p2">
            Our mission is to link the church of the First World with the church
            of the Third World in a manner that helps both the materially poor
            and the poor in spirit.

          <h3>Vission</h3>
          <p class="p2">
            Food For The Poor is God’s instrument to help the materially poor
            and to renew the poor in spirit. Our ministry is a reflection of our
            Lord’s unconditional love – a love that surrenders all, that
            inspires trust and faith, and that embraces all people, regardless
            of race, status or creed. It is also shaped by our belief that
            Christ is alive and can be served directly by serving those in
            greatest need.

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p class="p2">
            Caring for the poor and needy people and helping them is a noble
            endeavor. The more you give to poor and needy people, the more you
            strengthen their dependency. If you give them the chance or
            opportunity, you'll see an effective and long-lasting improvement in
            their lives.
