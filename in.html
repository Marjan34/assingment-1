          Poverty means not having enough money for basic needs such as food,
          drinking water, shelter, or toiletries. Many people in different
          countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of West and
          Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and some parts of
          Asia.Poverty is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress. One way
          of helping lower poverty is by educating poor people so that they can
          start contributing to a nation's economic development. Education
          teaches the poor about their rights and may show them the path to
          become an important part of the growth and expansion of the country.
          Vienna Declaration also tells this fact.
